# Proposal
# Introduction
The National Basketball Association is known to be one of the most lucrative professional sports in the world. The NBA athletes’ salary has increased over the years and the athletes’ contracts has been a topic of interest among many sports fans. There is a sea of data available about the NBA player’s ranking, scores, positions, and their contracts. The intriguing question is what factors and stats play the most important part in the decision of an NBA player’s salary. Our team has decided to attempt to answer this question through this project.


# Problem Definition
The salary cap and the luxury tax in the NBA will reach $113 and $136 million respectively for the 2021-2022 season. This puts substantial constraints on managers and coaches in trying to build a competitive team within these strict limitation. Thus, a model able to predict appropriate players’ salaries is crucial to the league. 
In this project we will use players’ data and stats from the past 5 seasons - as salaries have dramatically risen compared to earlier years - to find which ones are most correlated to salary and then predict the potential cap hit for the 2021-2022 season. The goal of this project is to provide reasonable recommendations to both players and teams regarding their intrinsic value base on their on-court performance.
