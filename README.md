# Problem Definition
The salary cap and the luxury tax in the NBA will reach $113 and $136 million respectively for the 2021-2022 season. This puts substantial constraints on managers and coaches in trying to build a competitive team within these strict limitation. Thus, a model able to predict appropriate players’ salaries is crucial to the league. 
In this project we will use players’ data and stats from the past 5 seasons - as salaries have dramatically risen compared to earlier years - to find which ones are most correlated to salary and then predict the potential cap hit for the 2021-2022 season. The goal of this project is to provide reasonable recommendations to both players and teams regarding their intrinsic value base on their on-court performance.
